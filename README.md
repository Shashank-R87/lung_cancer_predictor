# Enhanced Lung Cancer Prediction through Deep Learning and Genomic Case Matching: A Novel Approach to Precision Oncology

There were 2,480,675 new cases of lung cancer in 2022, according to World Cancer
Research Fund International. The diagnosis of lung cancer involves the use of imaging
tests, blood tests and various biopsies. Some of the biopsies provide gene samples, genes
are the instructions that inform how your body functions. They tell your cells which
proteins to make. Two major types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for about 85% of lung cancer and is
relatively insensitive to chemotherapy, compared to SCLC. Patients with NSCLC require
a complete staging workup to evaluate the extent of disease, because stage plays a major
role in determining the choice of treatment.

For reduced death rates and disease prevalence, early and accurate diagnosis of the illness is necessary. Using efficient deep learning networks and advanced algorithm techniques, the selection of important protein gene features, lung cancer prediction and the best matching case can be provided to give more insights and faster diagnosis. Feature selection is done by choosing the most prominent protein gene which causes lung cancer, this helps in achieving higher computational and avoids overfitting by dimensionality reduction.

Out of various machine learning models and deep learning networks it was found that Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) had the highest accuracy in predicting lung cancer with an accuracy of 98.75%. The best matching case file is determined based on TPM similarity, this provides more insights on the case and helps in faster diagnosis. This framework bridges the gap between complex computational workflows and clinical usability, enabling healthcare professionals and researchers to make data-driven decisions more effectively by incorporating robust client-server architecture.
